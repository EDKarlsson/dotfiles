# Environment Configuration Scripts

Collection of configuration files and scripts for setting up shell environment.

I originally created this a while ago as a bunch of random shell scripts to
simple configurations that I hated doing. Then recently I decided to fully commit
to Arch Linux and after the 3rd install because I screwed things up _badly_ lol
I thought it would be best to create something more robust and sustainable with
the tools and packages I like. Hopefully it will give a bit of inspiration and 
guidance to someone else!

This work had inspirations from other repositories that I really vibed with.

### Random notes
There are somethings in here that are not perfect. Like the tmux-dev-env is csh specific
and I can't remember why I did it it in csh. I think tmux and zsh just were not 
playing nicely together or I was trying to learn more about csh scripting.
